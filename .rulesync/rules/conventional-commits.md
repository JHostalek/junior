# Conventional Commits Specification v1.0.0

Reference: https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/

## Specification

1. Commits MUST be prefixed with a type (noun like `feat`, `fix`), followed by optional scope, optional `!`, and required colon and space.

2. The type `feat` MUST be used when a commit adds a new feature to your application or library.

3. The type `fix` MUST be used when a commit represents a bug fix for your application.

4. A scope MAY be provided after a type, consisting of a noun describing a codebase section surrounded by parenthesis, e.g., `fix(parser):`.

5. A description MUST immediately follow the colon and space after the type/scope prefix, providing a short summary of code changes.

6. A longer commit body MAY be provided after the short description, beginning one blank line after it.

7. A commit body is free-form and MAY consist of any number of newline-separated paragraphs.

8. One or more footers MAY be provided one blank line after the body. Each footer MUST consist of a word token, followed by either `:<space>` or `<space>#` separator, followed by a string value.

9. A footer's token MUST use `-` instead of whitespace characters, e.g., `Acked-by`. Exception: `BREAKING CHANGE`.

10. A footer's value MAY contain spaces and newlines; parsing MUST terminate when the next valid footer token/separator pair is observed.

11. Breaking changes MUST be indicated in the type/scope prefix or as a footer entry.

12. If in a footer, breaking change MUST consist of uppercase `BREAKING CHANGE`, followed by colon, space, and description.

13. If in the type/scope prefix, breaking changes MUST be indicated by `!` immediately before the `:`. If `!` is used, `BREAKING CHANGE:` MAY be omitted from the footer.

14. Types other than `feat` and `fix` MAY be used in commit messages.

15. Information units MUST NOT be treated as case-sensitive by implementors, except `BREAKING CHANGE` which MUST be uppercase.

16. `BREAKING-CHANGE` MUST be synonymous with `BREAKING CHANGE` when used as a footer token.
