# Example Intern Output

This is what the stdout output of a typical Intern run looks like.
When run via Junior, this becomes the task log.

## Example Generated Skill

This is what a generated `.claude/skills/config-edit-test/SKILL.md` looks like:

```yaml
---
name: config-edit-test
description: >
  Automate the config-edit-test cycle for package.json and tsconfig changes.
  Use when the user says "update config", "change tsconfig", or "modify package.json".
  Runs install and test after config changes automatically.
  Do NOT use for non-config file edits or source code changes.
allowed-tools: Read, Edit, Bash
---

# Config Edit & Test

Automates the repeated pattern of reading a config file, editing it, running install,
and running tests. Detected across 4 sessions where this sequence was performed manually.

## Steps

1. Read the target config file (package.json, tsconfig.json, .eslintrc, etc.)
2. Make the requested changes using Edit
3. Run the install command: `npm install` (or `bun install` if bun.lockb exists)
4. Run the test suite: `npm test` (or `bun test`)
5. If tests fail, show the error output and stop — do not auto-fix

## Constraints

- Do NOT skip the install step after package.json changes
- Do NOT run tests silently — always show full output
- Do NOT auto-fix test failures — stop and report

## When to Use / When NOT to Use

| Use When | Don't Use When |
|----------|----------------|
| Editing package.json dependencies | Editing source code files |
| Changing tsconfig compiler options | Changing environment variables only |
| Updating ESLint/Prettier config | Running one-off scripts |
| Modifying jest.config or vitest.config | Debugging test failures |

## Provenance

- **Generated by**: Intern skill
- **Pattern**: Read config -> Edit config -> Install deps -> Run tests
- **Category**: repetition
- **Source sessions**: 4 sessions between 2026-02-18 and 2026-02-21
- **Occurrences**: 4
- **Score**: 7.20
```

## Example CLAUDE.md Rule Addition

This is what Intern appends to `./CLAUDE.md`:

```markdown
## Variable Declarations
- Always use `const` by default. Only use `let` when the variable must be reassigned. Never use `var`.
<!-- intern: pattern="const-over-let" freq=5 confidence=0.85 date=2026-02-21 -->

## Pre-Commit Workflow
- Before creating any git commit, run `npm run lint` and fix any issues. Do not commit code with linting errors.
<!-- intern: pattern="lint-before-commit" freq=3 confidence=0.70 date=2026-02-21 -->
```

## Example Git Commit

```

    Skills added: config-edit-test
    Rules added: const-over-let, lint-before-commit
    Skills consolidated: css-helper + tailwind-setup → tailwind-styles
    Budget: 4,580/30,000 chars (15%)

    Source sessions: 12 sessions over 3 days
```
